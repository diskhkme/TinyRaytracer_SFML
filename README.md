# TinyRaytracer, SFML & ImGUI

According to the [TinyRatracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer) tutorial,
I implemented all steps and assignments. The result will appear if you 
press Render button on the GUI window. You can also tweak values for 
scene objects, camera and rendering. 

[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) is used to simply configure the window and 
to show the result pixel appeared on screen on the fly.
