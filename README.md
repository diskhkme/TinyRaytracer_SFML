# TinyRaytracer, SFML

According to the [TinyRatracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer) tutorial,
I implemented all steps and assignments. The result will appear if you 
press the space bar after the window started.

[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) is used to simply configure the window and 
to show the result pixel appeared on screen on the fly.

Check "ImGUI_Impl" branch for the application with editor GUI.
